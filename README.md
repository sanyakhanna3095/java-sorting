# Sorting
fundamental operation to rearrange a given array or list of elements in a particular order (ascending or descending)  
play a vital role in data organization, searching, and optimization

### Why sorting?
- reduces the complexity of a problem
- Organizing records
- Data visualization and pattern recognition
- Efficient data retrieval in databases and file systems


### How Sorting Works in Java
Java provides multiple ways to perform sorting:

- Manual Implementation: Using algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.

- Built-in Methods: Arrays.sort() for primitive types and Collections.sort() for objects.

- Custom Comparators: Implementing Comparable or Comparator interfaces for custom sorting.

## Key Differences Between Sorting Algorithms

| Sorting Algorithm | Best Case Time Complexity | Worst Case Time Complexity | Stability | In-Place |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| Bubble Sort     | O(n)                     | O(n²)                    | Yes      | Yes      |
| Selection Sort  | O(n²)                    | O(n²)                    | No       | Yes      |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n)                     | O(n²)                    | Yes      | Yes      |
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)               | O(n log n)               | Yes      | No       |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n)               | O(n²)                    | No       | Yes      |
| Heap Sort       | O(n log n)               | O(n log n)               | No       | Yes      |
| Counting Sort   | O(n + k)                 | O(n + k)                 | Yes      | No       |



## Real-World Example of Sorting
- E-commerce Websites: Sorting products by price, rating, or popularity.

- Databases: Sorting rows based on indexed keys.

- Search Engines: Sorting search results based on relevance.

- Stock Market Applications: Sorting stocks by price movements.


### Advantages of Using Sorting
- Efficient Searching: Speeds up operations like Binary Search.

- Optimized Performance: Reduces time complexity in data processing.

- Better Data Organization: Makes structured retrieval easier.

- Improved Readability: Well-organized data is easier to understand and analyze.


### When to Use Sorting Algorithms
- For Small Datasets: Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort (simpler but inefficient for large data).

- For Large Datasets: Quick Sort or Merge Sort (better time complexity).

- For Memory Constraints: In-place sorting like Quick Sort or Heap Sort.

- For Stability Requirements: Merge Sort or Insertion Sort (stable sorting preserves order of equal elements).


### Java Libraries that Support Sorting
1. Arrays.sort(): Uses Dual-Pivot Quick Sort for primitives and Tim Sort for objects.

2. Collections.sort(): Uses Tim Sort for sorting lists.

3. PriorityQueue: Uses a heap structure for automatic sorting.

4. TreeSet: Maintains sorted order using Red-Black Tree.

5. Stream API: Sorting using .sorted() method.
